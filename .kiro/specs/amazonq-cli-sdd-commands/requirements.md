# Requirements Document

## Introduction
This feature creates a standalone `amazonq-sdd` NPM package that enables Amazon Q CLI users to leverage the same spec-driven development workflow that Claude Code users enjoy through the cc-sdd package. By creating Amazon Q CLI-specific command templates and configuration, developers using Amazon Q CLI will be able to execute commands like `/kiro:spec-init` to initialize and manage structured development specifications.

The `amazonq-sdd` package provides a dedicated solution for Amazon Q CLI users, offering the same systematic development workflow while being tailored specifically to Amazon Q CLI's capabilities and interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Amazon Q CLI Command Template System
**User Story:** As an Amazon Q CLI user, I want to run spec-driven development commands similar to Claude Code's `/kiro:spec-init`, so that I can follow structured development workflows regardless of my AI assistant choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Amazon Q CLI command templates are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide Amazon Q CLI-specific command templates for all 8 SDD commands (spec-init, spec-requirements, spec-design, spec-tasks, spec-impl, spec-status, steering, steering-custom)
2. WHEN Amazon Q CLI command templates are generated THEN each template SHALL be formatted according to Amazon Q CLI's command specification requirements
3. IF Amazon Q CLI uses a different command format than Claude Code THEN the templates SHALL be adapted to Amazon Q CLI's native format while preserving identical functionality
4. WHEN templates are generated THEN they SHALL include proper metadata headers, argument handling, and tool specifications compatible with Amazon Q CLI
5. WHERE Amazon Q CLI has specific syntax or limitations THE command templates SHALL be adapted accordingly while maintaining feature parity with Claude Code commands

### Requirement 2: amazonq-sdd NPM Package Creation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standalone `amazonq-sdd` NPM package that provides spec-driven development for Amazon Q CLI, so that I can deploy SDD workflows to Amazon Q CLI projects with a single command.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user runs `npx amazonq-sdd@latest` THEN the system SHALL install Amazon Q CLI-specific SDD templates and configuration
2. IF Amazon Q CLI is not detected in the project THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for Amazon Q CLI setup
3. WHEN amazonq-sdd templates are installed THEN the system SHALL create the appropriate `.kiro/` directory structure and Amazon Q CLI command files
4. WHERE the user specifies language preferences (--lang en/ja/zh-TW) THE amazonq-sdd installation SHALL respect these preferences and generate localized documentation
5. WHILE being independent from cc-sdd THE amazonq-sdd package SHALL provide equivalent functionality tailored for Amazon Q CLI

### Requirement 3: Template Structure and Organization
**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want Amazon Q CLI templates organized in a clear structure, so that the amazonq-sdd package remains maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Amazon Q CLI templates are created THEN they SHALL be organized in a logical directory structure similar to the cc-sdd template organization
2. IF the template structure includes platform-specific variations THEN Amazon Q CLI SHALL support both `os-mac` and `os-windows` subdirectories like other agents
3. WHEN command templates are defined THEN they SHALL include appropriate frontmatter/metadata compatible with Amazon Q CLI's command system
4. WHERE Amazon Q CLI requires different configuration formats THE templates SHALL use Amazon Q CLI's native format (e.g., TOML, JSON, or other formats) rather than Markdown frontmatter if needed
5. WHILE maintaining consistency with other agents THE Amazon Q CLI templates SHALL adapt to Amazon Q CLI's specific capabilities and limitations

### Requirement 4: Feature Parity and Functionality
**User Story:** As an Amazon Q CLI user, I want access to the complete spec-driven development workflow, so that I have the same capabilities as Claude Code users.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Amazon Q CLI SDD commands are implemented THEN they SHALL provide identical functionality to their Claude Code counterparts
2. IF Amazon Q CLI has different tool restrictions or capabilities THEN the commands SHALL be adapted while maintaining core SDD workflow integrity
3. WHEN users execute Amazon Q CLI SDD commands THEN they SHALL generate the same `.kiro/specs/` and `.kiro/steering/` directory structures as other agents
4. WHERE Amazon Q CLI supports different argument passing mechanisms THE commands SHALL adapt the `$ARGUMENTS` variable handling appropriately
5. WHILE preserving the 3-phase approval workflow THE Amazon Q CLI implementation SHALL maintain requirements → design → tasks → implementation progression with human review gates

### Requirement 5: Documentation and Configuration
**User Story:** As an Amazon Q CLI user, I want proper documentation and configuration files, so that I can understand how to use the SDD features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria  
1. WHEN Amazon Q CLI templates are generated THEN the system SHALL create an `AMAZONQ.md` configuration file equivalent to `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code
2. IF multi-language support is requested THEN the system SHALL generate `AMAZONQ.en.md`, `AMAZONQ.ja.md`, and `AMAZONQ.zh-TW.md` files as appropriate
3. WHEN Amazon Q CLI documentation is created THEN it SHALL include instructions specific to Amazon Q CLI's interface and capabilities
4. WHERE Amazon Q CLI has different hook or automation capabilities THE documentation SHALL explain Amazon Q CLI-specific automation options or limitations
5. WHILE maintaining consistency with other agents THE Amazon Q CLI documentation SHALL be tailored to Amazon Q CLI users' needs and context

### Requirement 6: Testing and Validation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want assurance that Amazon Q CLI SDD commands work correctly, so that I can confidently deploy the feature to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Amazon Q CLI templates are generated THEN they SHALL be syntactically valid for Amazon Q CLI's command parsing system
2. IF Amazon Q CLI has a command validation mechanism THEN all generated templates SHALL pass validation  
3. WHEN the amazonq-sdd package generates Amazon Q CLI templates THEN the process SHALL complete without errors for all supported configurations (base, os-mac, os-windows)
4. WHERE Amazon Q CLI templates reference external files or configurations THEN all referenced paths and files SHALL exist and be accessible
5. WHILE ensuring quality THE Amazon Q CLI implementation SHALL include comprehensive test cases covering template generation, command execution, and workflow validation

### Requirement 7: CLI Integration and User Experience
**User Story:** As a user, I want a seamless experience installing and using Amazon Q CLI SDD features, so that adoption is straightforward and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user runs `npx amazonq-sdd@latest` THEN the installation SHALL complete successfully and provide clear feedback on what was installed
2. IF Amazon Q CLI is not detected or available THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages explaining requirements or setup steps
3. WHEN installation completes THEN users SHALL receive clear instructions on how to start using SDD commands in Amazon Q CLI
4. WHERE users need to configure Amazon Q CLI settings THE installation process SHALL provide guidance or automatic configuration where possible
5. WHILE being a standalone package THE amazonq-sdd SHALL provide equivalent user experience to cc-sdd but tailored for Amazon Q CLI
