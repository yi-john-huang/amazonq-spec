# Requirements Document

## Introduction
This feature creates a production-ready `amazonq-sdd` NPM package that provides native `/kiro:` command support in Amazon Q CLI through Custom Agents. The package enables Amazon Q CLI users to leverage the same systematic spec-driven development workflow that Claude Code users enjoy, but with native integration through Amazon Q CLI's Custom Agent system.

The `amazonq-sdd` package delivers a single-command installation (`npx amazonq-sdd`) that:
1. Installs an SDD Custom Agent configuration to `~/.aws/amazonq/cli-agents/sdd.json`
2. Creates local customizable templates in `.amazonq/commands/kiro/`
3. Generates comprehensive `AMAZONQ.md` documentation
4. Enables immediate use with `q chat --agent sdd` to execute commands like `/kiro:spec-init`

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: NPX Installation System
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install SDD functionality for Amazon Q CLI with a single command, so that I can start using spec-driven development workflows immediately without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user runs `npx amazonq-sdd` THEN the system SHALL download and execute a single installer file (~30KB)
2. WHEN installation completes THEN the system SHALL:
   - Write SDD Custom Agent configuration to `~/.aws/amazonq/cli-agents/sdd.json`
   - Create local templates in `.amazonq/commands/kiro/`
   - Generate `AMAZONQ.md` documentation file
3. IF Amazon Q CLI is not detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for Amazon Q CLI installation
4. WHEN installation succeeds THEN users SHALL be able to immediately use `q chat --agent sdd` to access SDD commands
5. WHILE being a standalone package THE installer SHALL include all necessary configurations and templates embedded within the installer file

### Requirement 2: Custom Agent Configuration with Local Templates
**User Story:** As an Amazon Q CLI user, I want native `/kiro:` command recognition in chat sessions with customizable behavior, so that I can use spec-driven development commands naturally and adapt them to my project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN users type `/kiro:spec-init <description>` in `q chat --agent sdd` THEN the agent SHALL recognize and execute the command using local template guidance
2. WHEN Custom Agent executes commands THEN it SHALL:
   - Have access to `fs_read` and `fs_write` tools restricted to `.kiro/**`, `*.md`, and `.amazonq/**` paths
   - Reference local templates in `.amazonq/commands/kiro/` for command behavior
   - Follow the detailed implementation logic defined in each template
3. IF users type unrecognized `/kiro:` commands THEN the agent SHALL provide helpful suggestions for correct syntax
4. WHEN the agent processes commands THEN it SHALL maintain workflow state through spec.json files in each feature directory
5. WHERE users need customization THEN they SHALL be able to edit templates in `.amazonq/commands/kiro/` to modify command behavior

### Requirement 3: Complete SDD Command Suite
**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to all 8 SDD commands through the Custom Agent, so that I have complete spec-driven development workflow capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the agent is configured THEN it SHALL support all 8 commands: `/kiro:spec-init`, `/kiro:spec-requirements`, `/kiro:spec-design`, `/kiro:spec-tasks`, `/kiro:spec-impl`, `/kiro:spec-status`, `/kiro:steering`, `/kiro:steering-custom`
2. WHEN users execute commands THEN each command SHALL provide equivalent functionality to the original shell script versions
3. IF workflow gates are required (e.g., design requires approved requirements) THEN the agent SHALL enforce these constraints with clear user prompts
4. WHEN commands generate files THEN they SHALL create the same `.kiro/specs/` and `.kiro/steering/` directory structures as other SDD implementations
5. WHILE using Amazon Q CLI's tools THE agent SHALL generate professional, enterprise-quality documentation and maintain workflow integrity

### Requirement 4: Workflow State Management
**User Story:** As a user following the SDD workflow, I want the system to track my progress and enforce approval gates, so that I maintain quality and don't skip important steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN users initialize specs THEN the system SHALL create spec.json files with phase tracking and approval states
2. WHEN users attempt to skip workflow phases THEN the agent SHALL prevent progression and prompt for required approvals
3. IF users run `/kiro:spec-design` without approved requirements THEN the agent SHALL show "Have you reviewed requirements.md? [y/N]" prompt
4. WHEN workflow states change THEN spec.json files SHALL be updated with current phase and timestamps
5. WHILE enforcing gates THE system SHALL provide clear status reporting through `/kiro:spec-status` command

### Requirement 5: File System Operations
**User Story:** As a user, I want the SDD agent to manage project files correctly, so that my specs are organized consistently and safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the agent writes files THEN it SHALL create proper directory structures (.kiro/specs/{feature}/, .kiro/steering/)
2. WHEN generating content THEN the agent SHALL use fs_read to check existing files before overwriting
3. IF directory permissions are insufficient THEN the agent SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN creating templates THEN the agent SHALL generate professional markdown with consistent formatting and structure
5. WHERE file conflicts exist THE agent SHALL prompt users for resolution rather than silently overwriting

### Requirement 6: Zero Dependencies Approach
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the SDD package to have no external dependencies, so that installation is fast, secure, and doesn't introduce supply chain risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN users install via NPX THEN the system SHALL download only a single installer file with embedded agent configuration and templates
2. WHEN the installer runs THEN it SHALL use only Node.js built-in modules (fs, path, os, child_process)
3. IF the installer requires external tools THEN it SHALL only depend on Amazon Q CLI being available in PATH
4. WHEN packaging for NPM THEN the package SHALL contain only: install.js, package.json, README.md, and LICENSE files
5. WHILE maintaining functionality THE package SHALL remain under 35KB total size

### Requirement 7: Documentation and User Experience
**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear documentation and helpful error messages, so that I can successfully install and use SDD features without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN users run the installer THEN they SHALL receive clear feedback about installation status and next steps
2. WHEN installation completes THEN users SHALL see instructions for starting their first spec with examples
3. IF errors occur during installation THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggested fixes
4. WHEN users need help THEN `npx amazonq-sdd help` SHALL display comprehensive usage information
5. WHILE being standalone THE package SHALL include links to full documentation and support resources

### Requirement 8: Cross-Platform Compatibility
**User Story:** As a developer on any operating system, I want the SDD package to work consistently, so that my team can use the same tools regardless of platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN users install on macOS, Windows, or Linux THEN the installer SHALL work identically on all platforms
2. WHEN determining Amazon Q CLI paths THEN the system SHALL correctly locate agents directory across different operating systems
3. IF platform-specific issues arise THEN the installer SHALL provide platform-appropriate error messages and solutions
4. WHEN creating file paths THEN the system SHALL use Node.js path utilities for cross-platform compatibility
5. WHILE maintaining consistency THE system SHALL respect platform-specific conventions (e.g., path separators, home directories)
