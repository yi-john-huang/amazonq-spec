# Generate Feature Requirements

I need to create detailed requirements for a feature specification. Please help me generate comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements.

## Feature Information
- **Feature Name**: {{FEATURE_NAME}}
- **Project Name**: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
- **Specification Path**: {{SPEC_PATH}}

## Context
{{#if EXISTING_SPEC}}
I have an existing specification document that includes the feature overview and initial analysis. Please build upon this foundation to create detailed requirements.
{{else}}
This is a requirements-first approach. Please create requirements based on the feature description provided.
{{/if}}

## Feature Details
{{FEATURE_DETAILS}}

## Current Understanding
{{#if CURRENT_ANALYSIS}}
Based on the current specification analysis:
{{CURRENT_ANALYSIS}}
{{/if}}

## Request

Please generate a comprehensive requirements document that includes:

### 1. Functional Requirements
- Core functionality that the feature must provide
- User interactions and workflows
- Data handling and processing requirements
- Integration points with existing systems
- Input/output specifications

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance requirements (response times, throughput)
- Security requirements
- Scalability considerations
- Usability requirements
- Compatibility requirements
- Reliability and availability requirements

### 3. Business Rules
- Validation rules
- Business logic constraints
- Workflow rules
- Data integrity requirements

### 4. Technical Constraints
- Technology stack limitations
- Platform requirements
- Third-party dependencies
- Architecture constraints

### 5. Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, testable criteria for each requirement
- Success metrics
- Edge cases and error conditions

## Expected Output Format

Please structure the requirements document as follows:
```markdown
# Requirements: [Feature Name]

## Overview
[Brief summary of what will be built]

## Functional Requirements
### FR-001: [Requirement Title]
**Description**: [Clear description]
**Priority**: High/Medium/Low
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Non-Functional Requirements
### NFR-001: [Requirement Title]
**Description**: [Clear description]
**Metric**: [Measurable criteria]
**Priority**: High/Medium/Low

## Business Rules
### BR-001: [Rule Title]
**Description**: [Rule description]
**Impact**: [What happens if violated]

## Technical Constraints
### TC-001: [Constraint Title]
**Description**: [Constraint description]
**Rationale**: [Why this constraint exists]
```

Please ensure all requirements are:
- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
- **Measurable**: Include quantifiable criteria where possible
- **Achievable**: Technically feasible within project constraints
- **Relevant**: Aligned with business objectives
- **Time-bound**: Include any temporal constraints

After generating requirements, the next step will be design using `/kiro:spec-design {{FEATURE_NAME}}`.
