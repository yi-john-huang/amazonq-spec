# Feature Specification Status Check

I need to check the current progress and status of a feature specification. Please help me analyze the current state and provide guidance on next steps.

## Feature Information
- **Feature Name**: {{FEATURE_NAME}}
- **Project Name**: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
- **Specification Directory**: {{SPEC_DIRECTORY}}

## Current State Analysis
{{#if SPEC_PATH}}
**Specification Path**: {{SPEC_PATH}}
{{/if}}

{{#if REQUIREMENTS_PATH}}
**Requirements Path**: {{REQUIREMENTS_PATH}}  
{{/if}}

{{#if DESIGN_PATH}}
**Design Path**: {{DESIGN_PATH}}
{{/if}}

{{#if TASKS_PATH}}  
**Tasks Path**: {{TASKS_PATH}}
{{/if}}

## Status Check Request

Please analyze the current specification state and provide a comprehensive status report including:

### 1. Phase Completion Analysis
Check which SDD phases are complete:
- **Specification Initialization**: Has the initial spec been created?
- **Requirements Phase**: Are requirements documented and approved?
- **Design Phase**: Is the technical design complete and approved?
- **Task Breakdown**: Have implementation tasks been defined?
- **Implementation Phase**: What is the current implementation progress?

### 2. Document Quality Assessment
For each existing document, evaluate:
- Completeness and thoroughness
- Clarity and readability
- Alignment with SDD best practices
- Missing sections or information
- Consistency across documents

### 3. Workflow Compliance Check
Verify adherence to SDD workflow:
- Are approval gates properly documented?
- Have prerequisites been met for each phase?
- Are there any workflow violations or skipped steps?
- Is the progression logical and well-structured?

### 4. Gap Analysis
Identify missing or incomplete elements:
- Required documents not yet created
- Incomplete sections within existing documents
- Missing approval confirmations
- Unaddressed requirements or design concerns

### 5. Next Steps Recommendation
Based on the current state, recommend:
- Immediate next actions to take
- Which SDD command to run next
- Any corrections needed to existing documents
- Priority order for outstanding tasks

## Expected Output Format

Please provide the status report in this structure:

```markdown
# Feature Status Report: [Feature Name]

## Current Phase
**Active Phase**: [Current SDD phase]  
**Overall Progress**: [Percentage or description]

## Phase Status Summary

- **Medium Priority Issues**: [Important but not blocking]  
- **Low Priority Issues**: [Nice-to-have improvements]

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. [First priority action]
2. [Second priority action]

### Next Command to Run
**Recommended**: `/kiro:spec-[command] [feature-name]`
**Reason**: [Why this is the logical next step]

### Future Considerations
- [Longer-term planning items]
- [Potential improvements or optimizations]
```

## Context-Specific Analysis
{{#if CURRENT_ISSUES}}
**Known Issues to Address**:
{{CURRENT_ISSUES}}

Please pay special attention to these issues in your analysis.
{{/if}}

{{#if TEAM_CONCERNS}}
**Team Concerns**:
{{TEAM_CONCERNS}}

Please address these concerns in your recommendations.
{{/if}}

{{#if TIMELINE_CONSTRAINTS}}
**Timeline Constraints**:
{{TIMELINE_CONSTRAINTS}}

Please factor these constraints into your next steps recommendations.
{{/if}}

## Validation Requests
Please also validate:
- Are all specification documents following consistent formatting?
- Do the requirements align with the initial specification?
- Does the design properly address all requirements?
- Are the tasks comprehensive and actionable?
- Is there proper traceability between phases?

## Success Metrics
Help me understand:
- How complete is this specification compared to SDD best practices?
- What percentage of the SDD workflow has been completed?
- Are we on track for successful implementation?
- What are the key quality indicators for this specification?

The goal is to get a clear picture of where we are in the SDD process and what we need to do next to move forward effectively.
