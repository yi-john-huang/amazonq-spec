# Initialize Feature Specification

I need to create a comprehensive specification for a new feature in my project. Please help me initialize the specification document with proper structure and initial analysis.

## Feature Description
{{FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}}

## Project Context
- **Project Name**: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
- **Technology Stack**: {{TECHNOLOGY_STACK}}
- **Project Path**: {{PROJECT_PATH}}
- **Architecture**: {{ARCHITECTURE_TYPE}}

## Request

Please create an initial specification document that includes:

1. **Feature Overview**: A clear description of what this feature does and why it's needed
2. **Scope Definition**: What is included and explicitly what is NOT included in this feature
3. **Initial Analysis**: Basic technical considerations and potential challenges
4. **Stakeholder Impact**: Who will be affected by this feature
5. **Next Steps**: Recommended approach for requirements gathering

## Expected Output

Create a structured specification document in markdown format that follows these guidelines:
- Use clear, professional language
- Include sections for all major specification components
- Provide templates for future requirements, design, and tasks sections
- Include relevant metadata and tracking information

Please ensure the specification is ready for the requirements phase using `/kiro:spec-requirements {{FEATURE_NAME}}`.
